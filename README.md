## Tools used 
 - React (with hooks) 
 - Sass
 
 I went with React for this project, while for a task this small it is heavy handed to bring in a framework I felt it would give a better sample of the type of code i would write while being part of the team and how I would structure things. 
 
 I also added Sass (syntactically awesome style sheets). I only picked this up a year ago so decided to use this chance to flex it a bit and i've found it produces much nicer looking stylesheets which are easier to work with, and makes it much easier to share styles across your application with things like utility classes. Especially when paired with BEM naming conventions(http://getbem.com/naming/), which is somehing i picked up in my last position. It makes it really easy to see which styles go with what components and adds structure and common conventions to your styles 
 
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
